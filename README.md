Helianto Spring service.

## Overview

Helianto Spring is the KaaS Ecosystem Provider IAM - Identity and Access
 Management. Once Helianto Spring - HSP for short - is added to any micro service
 orchestration tool, it will be ready to 1) keep identities, 2) relate them to 
 entities and 3) represent such combination as users, each user having 
 specific 4) authorities applicable to the owning entity. All of the above 
 constitute a context. More than one HSP may exist in the same micro service
 environment, but each one should have a distinct context name.
